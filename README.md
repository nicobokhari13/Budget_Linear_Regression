# CIS481_ModelSelectionForFederalBudgetDeficit

Utilizing Cross Validation with iterations over folds of a training set and the Root-Mean-Squared-Error(RMSE) measure of performance, this MATLAB code produces a Linear Regression model to predict the Federal Budget Deficit given an input year. 

A graph is produced with the plot of the Training Set and the Target Function h(x) represented by a linear combination of weights (w) and the normalized input year (x) 

Normalization was applied to both the input and output of the Training Set. The RMSE was calcualted with 
non-normalized h(x) values and non-normalized Training output (The Training output was transformed from normalized space to original space.
