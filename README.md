# CIS481_ModelSelectionForFederalBudgetDeficit

Utilizing Cross Validation with iterations over folds of a training set and the Root-Mean-Squared-Error(RMSE) measure of performance, this MATLAB code produces a Linear Regression model to predict the Federal Budget Deficit given an input year. 

A graph is produced with the plot of the Training Set and the Target Function h(x) represented by a linear combination of weights (w) and the normalized input year (x) 

Z-Score Normalization was applied to both the input and output of the Training Set. RMSE was calclated with this normalization applied. 

Output file 'w.dat' provides coefficients for the terms in Target Function Polynomial.
